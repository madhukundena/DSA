## Binary Search <br>
When to apply Binary Search <br>
Binary Search on Reverse Sorted array<br>
Order Not known Search <br>
First occurrance of an element <br>
Last occurrance of an element <br>
Count of an Element in a sorted array <br>
Number of times sorted array is rotated <br>
Finding the element in a rotated sorted array <br>
Searching in a Nearly sorted array <br>
Finding floor of an element in a sorted array <br>
Finding ceil of an element in a sorted array <br>
Next Alphabetical element <br>
Find the postition of an element in an infinite sorted array
Index of first 1 in binary sorted infinite array <br>
Binary search answer concept <br>
Find the maximum of the bitonic array <br>
Find the element in a bitonic array <br>
Search row wise and coloumn wise in an array <br>
Allocate minimun number of pages <br>
Count Element Occurence <br>
Rotated Array <br>
Time complexity of a binary search is O(log n) <br>

## Stack

NSL | NEAREST SMALLER TO LEFT <br>
Nearest Smaller to Right <br>
